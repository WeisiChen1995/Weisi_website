As someone who typically prefers spending weekends quietly at home, I don’t usually attend concerts. But for the first time in my life, I decided to go to Mayday’s concert in Sydney. Given how chaotic this February has been, with both physical and emotional exhaustion, I just wanted to do something different.

Thanks to my partner, who, despite his reservations about me attending a late-night concert, quietly booked a hotel nearby for me. This way, I could fully enjoy the concert without worrying about how I’d get home afterward—though it ended up costing another 💲300 just for the experience...Thanks also to Chenlu, who came to Sydney from Adelaide, and I had a wonderful weekend with her. We are both introverts, full of what others might consider 'strange/unique' thoughts and behaviors (haha), and I immediately felt a connection with her. We both try to 'survive' in this world in our own unique ways.

I stayed pretty calm during the first half of the concert—it had been a long time since I last listened to Mayday (I was a huge fan back in primary and senior high school-Ah,so old!). But somehow, I completely lost control in the second half, getting swept up in the crowd—screaming and dancing with my camera, phone, light stick, and handbag in hand, constantly dropping one thing after another. The highlight was when Jay Chou appeared on stage as a special guest. I screamed like I was one of his biggest fans 🤔. Mayday's concert is always like a massive midnight dance party!!!


In the song "疯狂世界"：

<center>

<i>
回憶多麼美，活著多狼狽  

為什麼這個世界，總要叫人傷悲  

我不能了解，也不想了解  

我好想好想飛，逃離這個 疯狂世界 

那麼多苦 那麼多淚 那麼多莫名的眼淚

The phrase 'unexplainable tears'—Ashin sings the most heart-wrenching lyrics set to the most upbeat melodies.



And in the song "玫瑰少年":

<center>

<i>
哪朵玫瑰沒有荊棘

最好的 報復是 美麗

最美的 盛開是 反擊

別讓誰去 改變了你

你是你 或是你 都行

會有人 全心的 愛你
</i>

Thank you, Mayday. I’m exhausted from trying to be someone else. From now on, I just want to be myself.

May peace be with us 🕊️

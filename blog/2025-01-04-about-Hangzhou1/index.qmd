Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, everything changed. I began to deeply miss Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red maple leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweets and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.

Due to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.

Yet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).

So here it is—Hangzhou, my beloved city.

### About Hangzhou
**Hangzhou (杭州)** is the capital city of the Zhejiang providence. Nestled in the heart of eastern China, Hangzhou is a city where timeless charm meets vibrant modernity. Renowned for its breathtaking **West Lake (西湖)**, a symbol of natural beauty and serenity, Hangzhou has inspired poets and painters for centuries. Beyond its historic allure, the city thrives as a hub of innovation, home to global tech giant Alibaba and a burgeoning digital economy. With its harmonious blend of ancient temples, bustling markets, cutting-edge architecture, and verdant tea plantations, Hangzhou offers a captivating journey through history and progress.


### Beishan St (北山街) <br> <一条北山街，半步民国史>

**Beishan Street (北山街)** is a picturesque historic avenue that runs along the northern shore of the iconic West Lake. Known for its blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage, the street is lined with ancient trees, traditional Chinese architecture, and several historical sites, including former residences of notable figures and old temples. The area exudes a tranquil charm, making it a favorite spot for leisurely strolls, photography, and cultural exploration.

The **保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda)** is a historic and iconic landmark situated on **宝石山 (Precious Stone Hill)** near the northern shores of West Lake. Its origins trace back to 五代十国 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) period, build in 968. Historically, the pagoda served both a religious purpose - as a Buddhist structure, it symbolized blessings and peace. <br><br>
Over the centuries, the Baoshu Pagoda has undergone multiple reconstructions due to damage from natural wear and conflicts. The most recent restoration was completed in the 20th century, ensuring its preservation for future generations.<br><br>
The pagoda is renowned for its slender and elegant design, standing at 45.3 meters tall. Its architectural style is distinct, with a gracefully tapering structure that appears almost like a delicate needle pointing toward the sky. Hence, there is an old saying: "湖上两浮屠，宝石如美人，雷峰如老衲" ("The two pagodas on the lake, Baoshu like a beautiful woman, Leifeng like an old monk").<br><br>
Today, the Baoshu Pagoda remains a beloved feature of Hangzhou's landscape, admired for its historical importance and the breathtaking views it offers of West Lake and the surrounding area. Its presence is a testament to the city's long-standing cultural and architectural achievements. </span>

**The Broken Bridge (断桥)** in winter. Photo captured by Weisi on the 7 Jan 2025.<br>
The Broken Bridge is located at the eastern end of Bai Causeway on the West Lake. One end connects to Beishan Road on the north shore of West Lake, while the other end leads to the **Mid-Lake Pavilion in the Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake (平湖秋月)** and the **Solitary Hill (孤山)**. The current bridge was rebuilt in 1921.<br><br>
**The origin of the name "Broken Bridge"**<br>
There are many legends about the origin of the name "Broken Bridge." One famous legend describes that after a winter snow, when viewed from Baoshi Hill to the south, West Lake is draped in silver, with Bai Causeway stretching across snow-covered willows and frosted peach trees. The stone arches of the Broken Bridge are exposed, with no cover or barriers, allowing the ice and snow to melt under the sunlight, while the ends of the bridge remain covered in bright white snow. The faintly visible stone bridge arches seem to appear and disappear, contrasting with the gray-brown bridge deck, creating an illusion of the bridge being broken. Thus, it is named the Broken Bridge. It is selected as one of the Ten Scenes of West Lake, named "**Lingering Snow on Broken Bridge (断桥残雪)**". <br><br>
**Love Bridge**<br>
The Broken Bridge in Hangzhou holds a special place in Chinese folklore as one of the "Three Love Bridges" and is famously associated with the legend **"The Legend of the White Snake" (白蛇传)**. According to the tale, it was on the Broken Bridge that Bai Niangzi (白娘子), a white snake spirit, and Xu Xian (许仙), a mortal man, first crossed paths. This chance meeting blossomed into a legendary romance that remains one of China's most cherished love stories.</span>

This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet **Bai Juyi (白居易)** penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):

孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。<br>
几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。<br>
乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。<br>
最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。<br><br>
(To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion, <br>
The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low.<br>
Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud.<br>
Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves.<br>
I love strolling along the east side of the lake most,<br>
Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.) </span>

**Love Bridge**<br>
The ancient legend of **Su Xiaoxiao (苏小小)** unfolds here. Su Xiaoxiao was a Song Dynasty courtesan, born in Hangzhou. Her home was near Xicun. Su Xiaoxiao was intelligent, beautiful, talented, and dignified. Once, while traveling by carriage to enjoy the scenery at Bai Causeway, she encountered a young man named Ruan Yu (son of the prime minister of the Southern Qi Dynasty), who was slowly approaching on a green horse from the Broken Bridge. They fell in love at first sight. After Su Xiaoxiao's death, she was buried beside Xiling Bridge at Xiling Bank. Later generations built a **Mucai Pavilion (慕才亭)** on her tomb, and visitors passing by the bridge would pay their respects at her grave.

Its idyllic location near West Lake and its legacy of artistic and cultural excellence make it a significant landmark in Chinese art history.<br><br>
In recent years, the Xiling Seal Art Society has gained additional attention through its mention in the popular Chinese tomb-raiding adventure novel series, 盗墓笔记 (The Lost Tomb), by 南派三叔 (Nanpai Sanshu). This integration into the narrative adds an air of mystery and historical intrigue to the society’s rich heritage. The immense popularity of the novel series has drawn millions of young visitors from across China, eager to experience the cultural and artistic atmosphere of this iconic site firsthand.

**Qiu Jin (秋瑾)** (1875–1907), a trailblazing revolutionary and feminist, is celebrated as a national heroine in Chinese history. Born in Fujian and raised in Zhejiang, Qiu Jin grew up during a time of great social and political turmoil in late Qing China. Known as the "Woman Knight of Mirror Lake" (鉴湖女侠), she became a symbol of courage, independence, and the fight for equality. <br><br>
In her lifetime, she once said, "If I die, I would like to be buried in Xiling (*如果不幸牺牲，愿埋骨西泠*)". After a number of relocation, Qiu Jin's tomb was finally from the Jilong Hill to the side of the Xiling Bridge in September 1981. On the front of her tomb's pedestal is an inscription by Dr. Sun Yat-sen (孙中山) that honors her legacy: "**Heroine Among Heroes (巾帼英雄)**."

**Wenlan Pavilion (文澜阁)** is one of the esteemed "Seven Pavilions of the Complete Library in Four Sections" (七阁藏书楼). Constructed in 1782 during the Qing Dynasty under the decree of Emperor Qianlong, it was designed to house a copy of the monumental literary collection, **Siku Quanshu (四库全书, Imperial Collection of Four Divisions)**. This compilation, regarded as the largest collection of Chinese texts in history, encompasses works across the four divisions: classics, history, philosophy, and literature.<br><br>
While other Qing Dynasty libraries were either safeguarded in imperial locations or tragically lost to the flames of war, Wenlan Pavilion and its Imperial Collection of Four Divisions endured. Despite facing the ravages of conflict and the changes of time, it was ultimately restored, thanks to the persistent efforts of generations of literati and scholars who recognized, transcribed, and preserved the scattered volumes. This remarkable survival stands as a cultural miracle in Chinese history.<br><br>
Today, Wenlan Pavilion, situated by the picturesque West Lake, continues to embody profound cultural significance. It serves as a living testament to the enduring legacy of Chinese culture and scholarship, spreading its rich humanistic heritage to the world.

**Juxian Pavilion (集贤亭)** in winter. Photo captured by Weisi on 8 Jan 2025. In the fourth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1726), Li Wei, the Governor of Zhejiang, rebuilt the Archery Pavilion, renaming it **Juxian Pavilion** (Pavilion of Gathering Virtues). He used this location to inspect the military training of the Eight Banners troops. Over time, Tingzi Bay gradually became a regular venue for the Eight Banners soldiers to practice horseback archery and martial arts.
Today, Juxian Pavilion is a popular destination where people gather to enjoy the scenic views and capture stunning photos, especially at sunset. It is at its most beautiful in summer, surrounded by the vibrant blooms of nearby lotus flowers.

**Yongjin Pool (涌金池)** is a well-known scenic spot, famous for its golden ox and the legend associated with it. According to the tale, in the Han Dynasty, a golden ox lay hidden at the bottom of West Lake. Whenever the lake dried up, causing crops to wither and people to suffer from water shortages, the golden ox would emerge, spouting water to refill the lake, providing irrigation for nearby farmlands and meeting the daily water needs of the local people. In an attempt to please the emperor, local officials once forced the villagers to drain the lake to capture the golden ox as a tribute. When the lake was emptied and the golden ox appeared, the officials rushed into the lake to seize it. However, the golden ox raised its head and roared in anger, spewing water that quickly flooded the area, drowning all the officials. From that time on, the waters of West Lake never dried up again, and the golden ox was never seen. <br><br>
The "Golden Ox Emerging from Water" sculpture in Yongjin Pool was erected in 2002. A waterside pier has also been built on the eastern shore of Yongjin Pool to provide visitors with a spot for taking photos and enjoying the scenery.<br><br>

Hangzhou—the city I hadn’t seen in six years, yet had never truly stopped missing. The weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red leaves on Beishan Street in autumn, and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms, and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days—all came rushing back to me. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, had become a cherished memory.

Returning home, I was struck by a profound sense of change. Familiar restaurants and shops had vanished. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight, now reaching nearly every corner. Towering high-rises filled the skyline, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.

Yet amidst all this transformation, West Lake remained timeless. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its serene beauty. Hangzhou’s charm is more than just a single lake—it lies in its natural landscapes, rich cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).

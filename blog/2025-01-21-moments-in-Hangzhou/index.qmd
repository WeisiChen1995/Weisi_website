Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, I began to deeply miss everything in Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red maple leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.

Due to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.

Yet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).

So here it is—Hangzhou, my hometown and my beloved city.

Bai Causeway is a picturesque path lined with willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind. This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):

孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。<br>
几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。<br>
乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。<br>
最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。<br><br>
(To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion, <br>
The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low.<br>
Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud.<br>
Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves.<br>
I love strolling along the east side of the lake most,<br>
Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.) </span>


#### 5. Go to Hefang ancient street to witness the bustling prosperity of the marketplace 🍜🍛🍲🥟.

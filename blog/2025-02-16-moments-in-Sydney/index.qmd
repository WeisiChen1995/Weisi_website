During my time in Sydney, I had the chance to explore a wide array of experiences that deepened my understanding of both my strengths and weaknesses. It became a transformative journey, one in which I gained greater clarity about what I truly want from life and what I'm capable of achieving. As I face the challenges of starting anew in 2025, I feel a blend of nervousness, fear, and overwhelm, but thereâ€™s also a profound sense of renewed hope. Iâ€™m ready to let go of the past while carrying forward the lessons learned from my mistakes.

Recently, I reconnected with an old friend, and we shared reflections on both the happiness and pain we experience in life. We came to realize that many of our struggles originate from within ourselves, and that simply changing our environment wonâ€™t solve everything. So, just try to live a better life, no matter where we areâ€”even when life feels like a constant struggle. 

Life moves forward relentlessly, even though we can only look back and reflect. Now, it is the time to embrace the future with faith. â™±.

During my time in Sydney, I was incredibly fortunate to explore a wide range of experiences, each of which deepened my understanding of both my strengths and weaknesses. It became a truly transformative journey, one where I not only discovered more about what I want from life but also what Iâ€™m capable of achieving. As I face the challenges of starting fresh in 2025, I feel a mix of nervousness, fear, and being a bit overwhelmed, but thereâ€™s also a profound sense of renewed hope. Iâ€™m ready to let go of the past, while carrying the lessons from my mistakes with me.

### Japanese cuisine
#### 1. **Sushi Kaido Chatswood**
📍: 7/376 Victoria Ave, Chatswood NSW 2067

🍣: Menu click [here](http://sushikaido.com.au)

💰: $40-60 per person

The restaurant is quite small, so there’s often a wait during peak dining hours. The sushi is exceptionally fresh, and the sashimi is rich and full of flavor. Each day, the restaurant features a daily special, with options like tuna belly, salmon belly, otoro, and more, all written on the board.

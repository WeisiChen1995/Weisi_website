Nanjing, a city that fulfill all my definitions of a "perfect city." With the lens of the China's ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: "I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here."

Some say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.

In my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.

If given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).

A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing. <br>
Doves are free, and so are we.

The stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.

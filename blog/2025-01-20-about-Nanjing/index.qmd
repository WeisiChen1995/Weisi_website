Nanjing, a city that satisfies all my definitions of a "perfect city." With the lens of the China's ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: "I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here."

Some say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.

In my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.

If given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).

A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing city. <br>
Doves are free, and so are we.

Red walls paired with wintersweet blossoms in winter. Wintersweet blossoms smell really nice.

The bald cypress trees by Yanque Lake in the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties create a stunning scene during autumn and winter.

The stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.

The view was amazing, however - Twelve years ago, I didn’t have time to climb to the top of the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. This time, though, due to maintenance, I only saw a '2.5D version' of it (bitter smile).

Like many ancient civilizations, the people of the Han dynasty believed in the immortality of the soul. They thought that if the body was well-preserved, the soul could one day reunite with the body, enabling rebirth. Therefore, they placed great emphasis on preserving the physical form. They believed that jade, as a substance imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, could prevent the body from decaying and symbolize noble status. As a result, nobles spared no expense, dedicating vast resources to crafting jade artifacts in pursuit of immortality. After death, they were dressed in jade burial suits, rested their heads on jade pillows, held jade pigs in their hands, and sealed their orifices with jade plugs. Some even adorned wooden coffins with jade pieces, leading to significant advancements in the use of jade for funerary purposes. <br>

##### - Treasure of the Museum: Golden creature (金兽) from around Qin & Han Dynasty (221 BCE-8 CE)

With a gold content of 99% and weighing 9,100 grams, it is the heaviest ancient gold cast artifact unearthed in China to date, and is referred to as the 'Treasure of Protection'. It has certainly drawn a massive crowd, with people eagerly surrounding it to take pictures! <br>

#### 5. Taste in Nanjing 🥟🦆🍲
Nanjing is renowned for its duck cuisine, so much so that there is a famous saying: "No duck can escape Nanjing alive." From Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup and Nanjing Roasted Duck to Salted Duck, Duck Fat Pastry, and Braised Duck Feet, the city offers an incredible array of mouthwatering duck dishes.

Beyond its mastery of duck, Nanjing is also famous for its diverse dumpling offerings. Favorites include Roast Duck Dumplings, Crab Roe Soup Dumplings, Mini Wontons, and Pan-Fried Dumplings.

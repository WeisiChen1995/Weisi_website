Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, everything changed. I began to deeply miss Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red maple leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweets in winter, and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.

Due to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.

Yet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).

So here it is—Hangzhou, my beloved city.

### Beishan St (北山街) | Lingering Snow on Broken Bridge<br> <一条北山街，半步民国史>
**Beishan Street (北山街)** is a picturesque historic avenue that runs along the northern shore of the iconic West Lake. Known for its blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage, the street is lined with ancient trees, traditional Chinese architecture, and several historical sites, including former residences of notable figures and old temples.

<span style="font-size: 0.95em;">**北山街 (Beishan St)**, **保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda)** in winter. Photo captured by Weisi on 7 Jan 2025. The **保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda)** is a historic and iconic landmark situated on **宝石山 (Precious Stone Hill)** near the northern shores of West Lake. Its origins trace back to 五代十国 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) period, build in 968. Historically, the pagoda served both a religious purpose - as a Buddhist structure, it symbolized blessings and peace. <br><br>
Over the centuries, the Baoshu Pagoda has undergone multiple reconstructions due to damage from natural wear and conflicts. The most recent restoration was completed in the 20th century, ensuring its preservation for future generations.<br><br>
The pagoda is renowned for its slender and elegant design, standing at 45.3 meters tall. Its architectural style is distinct, with a gracefully tapering structure that appears almost like a delicate needle pointing toward the sky. Hence, there is an old saying: "湖上两浮屠，宝石如美人，雷峰如老衲" ("The two pagodas on the lake, Baoshu like a beautiful woman, Leifeng like an old monk").<br><br>
Today, the Baoshu Pagoda remains a beloved feature of Hangzhou's landscape, admired for its historical importance and the breathtaking views it offers of West Lake and the surrounding area. Its presence is a testament to the city's long-standing cultural and architectural achievements. </span>

**The Broken Bridge (断桥)** in winter. Photo captured by Weisi on the 7 Jan 2025.<br>
The Broken Bridge is located at the eastern end of Bai Causeway on the West Lake. One end connects to Beishan Road on the north shore of West Lake, while the other end leads to the **Mid-Lake Pavilion in the Autumn Moon over the Calm Lake (平湖秋月)** and the **Solitary Hill (孤山)**. The current bridge was rebuilt in 1921.<br><br>
**The origin of the name "Broken Bridge"**<br>
There are many legends about the origin of the name "Broken Bridge." One famous legend describes that after a winter snow, when viewed from Baoshi Hill to the south, West Lake is draped in silver, with Bai Causeway stretching across snow-covered willows and frosted peach trees. The stone arches of the Broken Bridge are exposed, with no cover or barriers, allowing the ice and snow to melt under the sunlight, while the ends of the bridge remain covered in bright white snow. The faintly visible stone bridge arches seem to appear and disappear, contrasting with the gray-brown bridge deck, creating an illusion of the bridge being broken. Thus, it is named the Broken Bridge. It is selected as one of the Ten Scenes of West Lake, named "**Lingering Snow on Broken Bridge (断桥残雪)**". <br><br>
**Love Bridge**<br>
The Broken Bridge in Hangzhou holds a special place in Chinese folklore as one of the "Three Love Bridges" and is famously associated with the legend **"The Legend of the White Snake" (白蛇传)**. According to the tale, it was on the Broken Bridge that Bai Niangzi (白娘子), a white snake spirit, and Xu Xian (许仙), a mortal man, first crossed paths. This chance meeting blossomed into a legendary romance that remains one of China's most cherished love stories.</span>

Photo captured by Weisi on January 7, 2025. **Bai Causeway (白堤)** in winter—a picturesque path lined with willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind. This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet **Bai Juyi (白居易)** penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):

孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。<br>
几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。<br>
乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。<br>
最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。<br><br>
(To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion, <br>
The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low.<br>
Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud.<br>
Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves.<br>
I love strolling along the east side of the lake most,<br>
Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.) </span>

**Walking down memory lane...**<br>
I spent two years at Hangzhou No. 4 High School, located at Wushan Square, just about five minutes from the southern shore of West Lake. Nearby lies one of the Ten Scenes of West Lake, **"Orioles Singing in the Willows (柳浪闻莺)".** During my second year of high school, when I was allowed to skip some classes to prepare for studying abroad, I often went there—whether I felt sad, happy, or simply bored. Entire afternoons would slip away as I sat amidst the beautiful scenery, doing nothing but soaking it all in.<br><br>
Now, the 15-year-old high school student I once was is about to turn 30. I haven’t been back to Hangzhou in over six years, partly due to COVID and partly because of work and study commitments. Today, there’s even a subway line that goes directly from my home to Wushan Square. So much has changed—the shops and restaurants I once knew have all been replaced, and it took me some time to even locate my old high school. Yet, standing outside and watching students in their uniforms walk through the school gate, it felt as though time had rewound. Fifteen years ago, I was one of them.<br><br>
When I strolled into the "Orioles Singing in the Willows" park, I was struck by how familiar it still felt. The scenery remained unchanged. It was surreal—almost like a dream. Had I really returned? So many things, both good and bad, had happened since those high school days. Memories of names and faces flooded my mind, even though most of those people are no longer part of my life. I couldn’t help but wonder what they were doing now—many of them must be married by this point.<br><br>
My old favorite spot—a chair near the lake—was still there, empty and waiting. I sat down and let myself be carried away by nostalgia. Then, to my surprise, I saw a familiar face. It was one of my high school teachers, looking almost exactly as she had 15 years ago. I couldn’t recall her name or even the subject she taught, and I hesitated to say anything. She passed by without a word. I doubted she remembered me either—it had been 15 years, after all.

**Juxian Pavilion (集贤亭)** in winter. Photo captured by Weisi on 8 Jan 2025. In the fourth year of the Yongzheng reign of the Qing Dynasty (1726), Li Wei, the Governor of Zhejiang, rebuilt the Archery Pavilion, renaming it **Juxian Pavilion** (Pavilion of Gathering Virtues). He used this location to inspect the military training of the Eight Banners troops. Over time, Tingzi Bay gradually became a regular venue for the Eight Banners soldiers to practice horseback archery and martial arts. 
Today, Juxian Pavilion is a popular destination where people gather to enjoy the scenic views and capture stunning photos, especially at sunset. It is at its most beautiful in summer, surrounded by the vibrant blooms of nearby lotus flowers.

**Yongjin Pool (涌金池)** is a well-known scenic spot, famous for its golden ox and the legend associated with it. According to the tale, in the Han Dynasty, a golden ox lay hidden at the bottom of West Lake. Whenever the lake dried up, causing crops to wither and people to suffer from water shortages, the golden ox would emerge, spouting water to refill the lake, providing irrigation for nearby farmlands and meeting the daily water needs of the local people. In an attempt to please the emperor, local officials once forced the villagers to drain the lake to capture the golden ox as a tribute. When the lake was emptied and the golden ox appeared, the officials rushed into the lake to seize it. However, the golden ox raised its head and roared in anger, spewing water that quickly flooded the area, drowning all the officials. From that time on, the waters of West Lake never dried up again, and the golden ox was never seen. <br><br>
The "Golden Ox Emerging from Water" sculpture in Yongjin Pool was erected in 2002. A waterside pier has also been built on the eastern shore of Yongjin Pool to provide visitors with a spot for taking photos and enjoying the scenery.<br><br>

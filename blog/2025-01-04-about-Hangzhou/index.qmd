<span style="font-size: 0.95em;">**北山街 (Beishan St)**, **保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda)** in the winter. Photo captured by Weisi on 7 Jan 2025. The **保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda)** is a historic and iconic landmark situated on **宝石山 (Precious Stone Hill)** near the northern shores of West Lake. Its origins trace back to **五代十国 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) period**, build in 968. Historically, the pagoda served both a religious purpose - as a Buddhist structure, it symbolized blessings and peace. <br><br>
Over the centuries, the **Baoshu Pagoda** has undergone multiple reconstructions due to damage from natural wear and conflicts. The most recent restoration was completed in the 20th century, ensuring its preservation for future generations.<br><br>
The pagoda is renowned for its slender and elegant design, standing at 45.3 meters tall. Its architectural style is distinct, with a gracefully tapering structure that appears almost like a delicate needle pointing toward the sky. Hence, there is an old saying: "湖上两浮屠，宝石如美人，雷峰如老衲" ("The two pagodas on the lake, Baoshu like a beautiful woman, Leifeng like an old monk").<br><br>
Today, the Baoshu Pagoda remains a beloved feature of Hangzhou's landscape, admired for its historical importance and the breathtaking views it offers of West Lake and the surrounding area. Its presence is a testament to the city's long-standing cultural and architectural achievements. </span>

Photo captured by Weisi on January 7, 2025. **Bai Causeway (白堤)** in winter—a picturesque path lined with willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind. This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet **Bai Juyi (白居易)** penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):

孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。<br>
几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。<br>
乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。<br>
最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。<br>

(To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion, <br>
The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low.<br>
Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud.<br>
Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves.<br>
I love strolling along the east side of the lake most,<br>
Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.) </span>

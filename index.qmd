### Welcome to my personal website!

My background is in pharmacy, and over time I transitioned into data-focused work, combining my clinical understanding with a strong interest in data analysis. I am particularly passionate about using data to generate meaningful insights that can inform health policy and improve population health outcomes.

My key interests lie in three areas: (1) coding, especially developing efficient workflows and automating data processes; (2) data visualization, through which I aim to present complex findings in clear and accessible ways; and (3) statistical and analytical methods, where I am continuously expanding my knowledge of modern approaches to understanding real-world data.

I have hands-on experience working with large, linked health administrative datasets, including nationwide hospital admissions, emergency department presentations, perinatal data collection, PBS and MBS data. These experiences have strengthened my skills in managing and analyzing complex data structures, ensuring data quality, and deriving insights from population-level information. I am proficient in SAS and R and use these tools extensively for data cleaning, statistical modeling, and visualization.

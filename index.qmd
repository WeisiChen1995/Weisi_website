### Welcome to my personal website!
Born and raised in [Hangzhou, China](https://weisichen1995.github.io/Weisi_website/blog/2025-01-21-moments-in-Hangzhou/), I moved to Sydney, Australia in 2015 to pursue university studies. I am intertested in technology, programming, data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, photography, exploring cities on foot, traveling, learning/exploring new things and cherishing moments with family and friends.

Born and raised in Hangzhou, China, I moved to Australia in 2015 to pursue university studies. I am a highly disciplined and hard-working individual with a strong passion for programming, data analysis, data visualization, and statistical modeling. With a background in pharmacy and health data science, I am interested in population-level analysis using linked data. My expertise lies in uncovering meaningful insights from complex datasets, driven by a commitment to improving health outcomes. I thrive on tackling challenging problems with analytical precision and creativity, always striving to deliver impactful results in every project I undertake.

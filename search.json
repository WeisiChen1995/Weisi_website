    "text": "🌦️ Project Background\nThis project examines rainfall patterns across New South Wales (NSW) in 2025 using data collected from rainfall stations. Because stations are unevenly distributed, not all areas of NSW are directly observed.\nTo estimate rainfall in unsampled regions, kriging, a spatial interpolation technique, was applied to the station data. For each month, a variogram model was fitted and explored to determine the most suitable kriging parameters, ensuring the interpolated map accurately represents spatial rainfall patterns across the state.\n\n\n📝 User’s Note\nThe results are presented through an interactive map:\n\nClick “Rain Stations” to view rainfall data for individual stations. Hover over stations to see rainfall data for each staton\nClick “Kriging” to see the interpolated rainfall map.\n\nAdditional details about the data sources and the kriging technique are provided at the bottom of the page.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLoading NSW Rainfall Kriging Map...\n\n  \n\n\n\nData\n\nDaily rainfall data: Downloaded from all available stations in NSW for 2025 (January–September at the time of download).\n\nSource: SILO Point Data\n\n\nStation and geographic data: Retrieved from SILO Patched Point Dataset\n\nDaily rainfall values were aggregated to monthly totals for analysis.\n\nThe process was automated using an R script to download rainfall data from all NSW stations, avoid the need for manual collection.\n\nInteractive download: Users can download the rainfall data directly from the interactive map.\n\n\nGithub Repository\nView the Github Repository."

    "title": "About Nanjing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Nanjing, a city that satisfies all my definitions of a “perfect city.” With the lens of the China’s ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: “I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here.”\nSome say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.\nIn my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.\nIf given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).\n\nMoments in Nanjing\n\n1. A flock of doves soaring through the sky at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage 🕊️\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage on 16 Jan 2025. A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing city.  Doves are free, and so are we.\n\n\n2. Red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms\n\n  \n\nRed walls paired with wintersweet blossoms in winter. Wintersweet blossoms smell really nice.\n\n \n\nThe bald cypress trees by Yanque Lake in the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties create a stunning scene during autumn and winter.\n\n \n\nThe stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.\n\n\n3. Climbing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and overlooking Zijin Mountain and Nanjing City\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Treasures in Nanjing Museum - The Enchantment of China’s Ancient Capital of the Six Dynasties\n\n- Jade clothes sewn with golden threat (金缕玉衣) from Western Han (202 BCE-8 CE)\n\n\n\nLike many ancient civilizations, the people of the Han dynasty believed in the immortality of the soul. They thought that if the body was well-preserved, the soul could one day reunite with the body, enabling rebirth. Therefore, they placed great emphasis on preserving the physical form. They believed that jade, as a substance imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, could prevent the body from decaying and symbolize noble status. As a result, nobles spared no expense, dedicating vast resources to crafting jade artifacts in pursuit of immortality. After death, they were dressed in jade burial suits, rested their heads on jade pillows, held jade pigs in their hands, and sealed their orifices with jade plugs. Some even adorned wooden coffins with jade pieces, leading to significant advancements in the use of jade for funerary purposes. \n\n\n- Treasure of the Museum: Golden creature (金兽) from around Qin & Han Dynasty (221 BCE-8 CE)\n\n \n\nWith a gold content of 99% and weighing 9,100 grams, it is the heaviest ancient gold cast artifact unearthed in China to date, and is referred to as the ‘Treasure of Protection’. It has certainly drawn a massive crowd, with people eagerly surrounding it to take pictures! \n\n\n-The prettiest: Rose quartz covered incense burner (芙蓉石蟠螭耳盖炉) from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Golden plate with the design of S-shaped cloud (如意云纹金盘) from Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tri-colored pottery camel (三彩骆驼🐫) from Tang Dynasty (618 to 907)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Some delicate clocks 🕰️ from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Taste in Nanjing 🥟🦆🍲\nNanjing is renowned for its duck cuisine, so much so that there is a famous saying: “No duck can escape Nanjing alive.” From Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup and Nanjing Roasted Duck to Salted Duck, Duck Fat Pastry, and Braised Duck Feet, the city offers an incredible array of mouthwatering duck dishes.\nBeyond its mastery of duck, Nanjing is also famous for its diverse dumpling offerings. Favorites include Roast Duck Dumplings, Crab Roe Soup Dumplings, Mini Wontons, and Pan-Fried Dumplings.\n\n- Nanjing Roasted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Salted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Crab Roe Soup Dumplings"

    "text": "Hangzhou—the city I hadn’t seen in six years, yet had never truly stopped missing. The weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red leaves on Beishan Street in autumn, and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms, and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days—all came rushing back to me. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, had become a cherished memory.\nReturning home, I was struck by a profound sense of change. Familiar restaurants and shops had vanished. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight, now reaching nearly every corner. Towering high-rises filled the skyline, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.\nYet amidst all this transformation, West Lake remained timeless. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its serene beauty. Hangzhou’s charm is more than just a single lake—it lies in its natural landscapes, rich cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).\n\nThings must do in Hangzhou\n\n1. Wait for sunset at the lakeside 🌅.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Visit the so-called ‘most beautiful corner’ of Gushan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Go to Beishan street and see the red leaves 🍁 in autumn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Go to Broken Bridge to listen to the love story of Xu Xian and Bai Suzhen 💝\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Take some photos at the beautiful Jixian Pavilion 𠅘.\n\n  \n\n\n\n6. Go to Bai Causeway and see the willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind 🍃.\n\n \n\n\n\n7.

Construction began in 1137, with major Gothic expansions taking place in the 14th and 15th centuries. Today, its south tower rises 136 meters into the sky, dominating the city skyline.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaroque-Style Architecture: Extreme Ornamentation and Dazzling Visual Impact\nVienna is home to countless Baroque-style churches, palaces, and buildings, which form a striking contrast to the Gothic St. Stephen’s Cathedral. While Gothic architecture emphasizes height, pointed lines, and verticality, Baroque architecture often features rounded forms, grandeur, and elaborate ornamentation. In contrast to the relative minimalism of Gothic design, Baroque embraces an “extreme ornamentation” style, with intricate details that create a dazzling visual impact.\n\nHofburg Imperial Palace\n\n \n\n\n\nAustria National Library – One of the World’s Most Beautiful Libraries\n\n    \n\n\n\nThe Plague Column\nThe Plague Column sits at the heart of Vienna.

Its intricate sculptures of angels, saints, and allegorical figures soar skyward, symbolizing both suffering and divine protection.\n\n\n\n\n\nBaroque-style church\n\n  \n\n\n\nThe Fusion of History and Art – Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna\nKnown as one of the most beautiful museums in the world, stepping inside the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna instantly captivated me with its exquisite frescoes and soaring domes. Within its grand halls, the museum houses countless priceless works of art, from Old Master paintings to ancient artifacts.\n\n   \n\n\n\n🤍 Ivory Art\nWhat impressed me most were the countless intricately carved ivory artworks on display. The human figures depicted in these pieces are astonishingly lifelike — the expressions, gestures, and even the subtle textures of muscles are rendered with remarkable precision! Standing before them, it’s impossible not to marvel at the extraordinary craftsmanship and patience required to create such delicate works of art. Each piece feels almost alive, indeed a testament to the skill and artistry of its creator.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\n🖼 The Museum’s Masterpiece: The Tower of Babel — Pieter Bruegel the Elder (1563)\nThe painting depicts the biblical story from the Book of Genesis, in which humanity, speaking a single language, attempts to build a tower tall enough to reach heaven. In response, God confounds their speech so that they can no longer understand one another, scattering them across the earth.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🩸 The Museum’s Masterpiece: The Death of Medusa — Peter Paul Rubens (early 17th century)\nRubens paints the severed head itself, surrounded by writhing snakes, still alive with venomous energy. Blood drips from Medusa’s neck, and serpents coil around the frame — a haunting representation of both beauty and terror.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n🍞🍷 The Museum’s Masterpiece: Still Life with Herring, Bread, and a Glass of Beer — Pieter Claesz (1597–1660)\nOne of my favorite art collections in the Kunsthistorisches Museum Vienna! The crispy crust of the bread, the shimmer of the fish scales, the transparency of the glass, and the soft folds of the napkin — so real that you almost expect to reach out and touch them.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRomantic Carriages of Vienna\nCarriages can be seen throughout Vienna, adding a unique and romantic atmosphere to the city. The coachmen’s traditional attire seems to transport visitors back to the Middle Ages. And, of course, as the carriages weave through the city center, we all cannot help but notice the horses’ distinctive scent!"

    "title": "About Nanjing",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Nanjing, a city that satisfies all my definitions of a “perfect city.” With the lens of the China’s ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: “I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here.”\nSome say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.\nIn my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.\nIf given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).\n\nMoments in Nanjing\n\n1. A flock of doves soaring through the sky at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage 🕊️\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage on 16 Jan 2025. A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing city.  Doves are free, and so are we.\n\n\n2. Red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms\n\n  \n\nRed walls paired with wintersweet blossoms in winter. Wintersweet blossoms smell really nice.\n\n \n\nThe bald cypress trees by Yanque Lake in the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties create a stunning scene during autumn and winter.\n\n \n\nThe stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.\n\n\n3. Climbing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and overlooking Zijin Mountain and Nanjing City\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Treasures in Nanjing Museum - The Enchantment of China’s Ancient Capital of the Six Dynasties\n\n- Jade clothes sewn with golden threat (金缕玉衣) from Western Han (202 BCE-8 CE)\n\n\n\nLike many ancient civilizations, the people of the Han dynasty believed in the immortality of the soul. They thought that if the body was well-preserved, the soul could one day reunite with the body, enabling rebirth. Therefore, they placed great emphasis on preserving the physical form. They believed that jade, as a substance imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, could prevent the body from decaying and symbolize noble status. As a result, nobles spared no expense, dedicating vast resources to crafting jade artifacts in pursuit of immortality. After death, they were dressed in jade burial suits, rested their heads on jade pillows, held jade pigs in their hands, and sealed their orifices with jade plugs. Some even adorned wooden coffins with jade pieces, leading to significant advancements in the use of jade for funerary purposes. \n\n\n- Treasure of the Museum: Golden creature (金兽) from around Qin & Han Dynasty (221 BCE-8 CE)\n\n \n\nWith a gold content of 99% and weighing 9,100 grams, it is the heaviest ancient gold cast artifact unearthed in China to date, and is referred to as the ‘Treasure of Protection’. It has certainly drawn a massive crowd, with people eagerly surrounding it to take pictures! \n\n\n-The prettiest: Rose quartz covered incense burner (芙蓉石蟠螭耳盖炉) from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Golden plate with the design of S-shaped cloud (如意云纹金盘) from Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tri-colored pottery camel (三彩骆驼🐫) from Tang Dynasty (618 to 907)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Some delicate clocks 🕰️ from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Taste in Nanjing 🥟🦆🍲\nNanjing is renowned for its duck cuisine, so much so that there is a famous saying: “No duck can escape Nanjing alive.” From Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup and Nanjing Roasted Duck to Salted Duck, Duck Fat Pastry, and Braised Duck Feet, the city offers an incredible array of mouthwatering duck dishes.\nBeyond its mastery of duck, Nanjing is also famous for its diverse dumpling offerings. Favorites include Roast Duck Dumplings, Crab Roe Soup Dumplings, Mini Wontons, and Pan-Fried Dumplings.\n\n- Nanjing Roasted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Salted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Crab Roe Soup Dumplings"

I am highly disciplined, detail-oriented, and driven by a strong passion for reproducible research, statistical analysis, and data visualization.\nI am proficient in statistical software such as R and SAS, with extensive experience in data cleaning, analysis, visualization, and statistical modelling. Over the years, I have worked extensively with large, linked health administrative datasets, gaining expertise in platforms such as SURE, PLIDA, and NHDH. My experience spans nationwide datasets, including hospital admissions, emergency department records, Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) and Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS) claims, and death registrations.\nIn addition, I have worked with NSW state-level data collections, covering perinatal records, birth registrations, child protection reports, public housing, NAPLAN, school enrollment, the Australian Early Development Census, out-of-home care, and justice system data.\nI am deeply committed to continuous learning and professional development, always eager to explore new packages, techniques, or skills that enhance my ability to analyze data effectively and deliver meaningful insights.\n\n\nProfessional Interests\n• Reproducible researching • Data Visualization • Statistical modeling\n\n\nEducation Background\n\n2021 – 2023, Master of Health Data Science, University of New South Wales\n\n2015 – 2019, Bachelor of Pharmacy, University of Sydney\n\n\n\nPublications\nGoogle Scholar Profile\n\n\nProfessional Experience\nI transitioned into data-focused work in 2021 through the Master of Health Data Science program at the University of New South Wales. My first quantitative project was my master’s dissertation at the Kirby Institute, UNSW, where I developed a mixed-effects model to examine changes in cardiovascular risk among people living with HIV. A key methodological challenge was that the outcome—cardiovascular risk—was expressed as a percentage, bounded between 0 and 1, which violates assumptions of standard linear models. To address this, I implemented a beta-distributed generalized linear mixed-effects model (GLMM) using the glmmTMB package in R, enabling flexible modeling of proportional outcomes while accounting for individual-level random effects.\nSince July 2023, I have worked as a Data Scientist at the School of Public Health, UNSW, and the School of Pharmacy, USYD. In this role, I have extensive experience working with large, linked administrative health datasets through platforms including SURE, PLIDA, and NHDH. My work spans national-level datasets such as hospital admissions, emergency department presentations, PBS, and MBS data, as well as NSW state-level datasets including perinatal data, birth registrations, Australian Early Development Census, public school enrollments, NAPLAN, child protection reports, out-of-home care placements, justice data, public housing data, and death registrations."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Hangzhou—the city I hadn’t seen in six years, yet had never truly stopped missing. The weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red leaves on Beishan Street in autumn, and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms, and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days—all came rushing back to me. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, had become a cherished memory.\nReturning home, I was struck by a profound sense of change. Familiar restaurants and shops had vanished. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight, now reaching nearly every corner. Towering high-rises filled the skyline, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.\nYet amidst all this transformation, West Lake remained timeless. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its serene beauty. Hangzhou’s charm is more than just a single lake—it lies in its natural landscapes, rich cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州). .\n\nThings must do in Hangzhou\n\n1. Wait for sunset at the lakeside 🌅.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2. Visit the so-called ‘most beautiful corner’ of Gushan.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3. Go to Beishan street and see the red leaves 🍁 in autumn.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Go to Broken Bridge to listen to the love story of Xu Xian and Bai Suzhen 💝\n\n\n\n\n\n5. Take some photos at the beautiful Jixian Pavilion 𠅘.\n\n  \n\n\n\n6. Go to Bai Causeway and see the willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind 🍃.\n\n \n\n\n\n7. Take a boat tour 🚤 around West Lake.\n\n\n\n\n\n8. Go to Hefang ancient street to witness the bustling prosperity of the marketplace 🍜🍛🍲🥟."

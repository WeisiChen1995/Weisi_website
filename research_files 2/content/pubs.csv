To describe changes in atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD) risk over time among people living with HIV (PLHIV).

Methods
We used data from the TREAT Asia HIV Observational Database (TAHOD) and the Australian HIV Observational Database (AHOD). Five-year ASCVD risk was calculated using the D:A:D equation. Individuals were eligible for inclusion if they were aged ≥18 years, had started ART, had no previous history of ASCVD and had complete ASCVD risk factor data available within the first 5 years of ART initiation.

Results
A total of 3368 adults contributed data, 3221 were from TAHOD and 147 were from AHOD. The median age at ART initiation was 36 [IQR 31–43] years for TAHOD participants, and 42 [IQR 35–50] years for AHOD participants. Most TAHOD (70.4%) and AHOD (91.8%) participants were male. Overall, ASCVD risk increased from 0.84% (95% CI 0.81%–0.87%) at ART initiation to 1.34% (95% CI 1.29%–1.39%) after 5 years on ART. After adjusting for traditional and HIV-associated ASCVD risk factors, ASCVD risk increased at a similar rate among sub-populations defined by HIV exposure (heterosexuals, men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs), race/ethnicity (Caucasian and Asian) and nadir CD4 at ART initiation (<200 and ≥200 cells/mm3).

Conclusions
These findings emphasize the growing burden of ASCVD risk among PLHIV and the need to develop interventions that are effective across a broad range of HIV sub-populations.",NA,"Chen, W., Petoumenos, K., Somia, A., Edmiston, N., Chaiwarith, R., Woolley, I., Ross, J., Pujari, S., Boettiger, D.

To estimate the national prevalence of antidementia and psychotropic medication use, and sociodemographic factors associated with their use, in Australians living with dementia.
Design
Retrospective cross-sectional study.
Setting and participants
Nationwide data linkage study using 2021 Census and Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS) data. All people aged 65 or older with dementia (self-reported in the Census or dispensed an antidementia drug subsidized by the PBS) were included.
Methods
Medication use was defined as at least 1 dispensing during the 3-month period following the Census (August–October 2021). Prevalence of antidementia and psychotropic medication use, including antipsychotics, benzodiazepines and Z-drugs, antiepileptics, opioids, and psychostimulants, was calculated. Sociodemographic factors associated with medication use were explored using multivariable logistic regression models.
Results
Of the 177,809 older people living with dementia included, 58.6% were using at least 1 psychotropic medication. Antidepressants were the most commonly used psychotropics (41%), followed by opioids (20%) and antipsychotics (13%). Antidementia medications were used by a quarter of people with dementia (26%).
People with dementia living in the highest socioeconomic area were more likely to use antidementia medications [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 1.22; 95% CI, 1.17–1.28] and less likely to use psychotropics (OR, 0.91; 95% CI, 0.88–0.95) compared with people living in the lowest socioeconomic area. Conversely, those living in inner regional areas were more likely to use psychotropics (OR, 1.06; 95% CI, 1.03–1.10) and less likely to use antidementia medications (OR, 0.79; 95% CI, 0.77–0.82) compared with people living in metropolitan areas.
Conclusions and Implications
Psychotropics were commonly used in people with dementia in Australia. Disparities in access to health care due to socioeconomic status or remoteness may have influenced the use of antidementia and psychotropic medications. Further strategies to allow more equitable access to resources and medications are needed.",NA,"Lau, E. C., Chen, W., Lu, C. Y., Hilmer, S. N., Jeon, Y., & Tan, E.

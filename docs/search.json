But for the first time in my life, I decided to go to Mayday’s concert in Sydney. Given how chaotic this February has been, with both physical and emotional exhaustion, I just wanted to do something different.\nThanks to my partner, who, despite his reservations about me attending a late-night concert, quietly booked a hotel nearby for me. This way, I could fully enjoy the concert without worrying about how I’d get home afterward—though it ended up costing another 💲300 just for the experience…Thanks also to Chenlu, who came to Sydney from Adelaide, and I had a wonderful weekend with her. We are both introverts, full of what others might consider ‘strange/unique’ thoughts and behaviors (haha), and I immediately felt a connection with her. We both try to survive in this cruel world in our own unique ways.\nI stayed pretty calm during the first half of the concert—it had been a long time since I last listened to Mayday (I was a huge fan back in primary and senior high school-Ah, so old!). But somehow, I completely lost control in the second half, getting swept up in the crowd—screaming and dancing with my camera, phone, light stick, and handbag in hand, constantly dropping one thing after another. The highlight was when Jay Chou appeared on stage as a special guest. I screamed like I was one of his biggest fans 🤔. Mayday’s concert is always like a massive midnight dance party!!!\nIn the song “疯狂世界”：\n\n 回憶多麼美，活著多狼狽\n為什麼這個世界，總要叫人傷悲\n我不能了解，也不想了解\n我好想好想飛，逃離這個 疯狂世界\n那麼多苦 那麼多淚 那麼多莫名的眼淚\n\n\nThe phrase ‘unexplainable tears’—Ashin sings the most heart-wrenching lyrics set to the most upbeat melodies.\nAnd in the song “玫瑰少年”:\n\n 哪朵玫瑰沒有荊棘\n最好的 報復是 美麗\n最美的 盛開是 反擊\n別讓誰去 改變了你\n你是你 或是你 都行\n會有人 全心的 愛你 \n\nThank you, Mayday. I’m exhausted from trying to be someone else. From now on, I just want to be myself.\nMay peace be with us 🕊️\nWeisi\n01.03.2025\n\n  \n\n\n\n      \n\n\nPhotos taken by Weisi and sponsored by Chenlu (when Weisi was too busy going crazy 😉)."

    "text": "Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, I began to deeply miss everything in Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.\nDue to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.\nYet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).\nSo here it is—Hangzhou, my hometown and my beloved city.\n\nThings must do in Hangzhou\n\n1.

    "title": "About 【三十而立】",
    "section": "",
    "text": "About [三十而立]…\nIn Chinese culture, there is a saying: “三十而立”, which means that by the age of 30, a person should have established their career, family, and moral principles. This stage of life signifies financial stability and independence, allowing a person to stand on their own.\nI only have a few months until I turn 30, and I am still trying to understand myself—figuring out my strengths and weaknesses and finding my true path, something I both somewhat enjoy and am good at. Three years ago, I finally made the move to transition my career, and I am so glad I did. Since then, life has had its ups and downs, and sometimes things haven’t worked out due to my knowledge, abilities, personality or other reasons. But I have no regrets. I always believe that every decision I make is the best one possible given the circumstances at the time. I always strive to do my best in everything I undertake in the present moment. Sometimes, things don’t work out because simply it wasn’t meant for me.\nNowadays, I often hear people on the internet praise the idea of “inner stability.” They say that true strength comes from within and that without it, we are left with only internal friction—something we must put an end to. However, over time, I’ve come to realize that stopping this internal friction often means sacrificing our sensitivity.\nI find myself caught in this paradox: You can be a highly sensitive and empathetic person, deeply attuned to the emotions of others, but also vulnerable to pain. Or, you can shield yourself from pain, becoming indifferent to both yourself and those around you—yet society will praise you for having a strong inner core.\nSo, what kind of person do I want to be?  That is a question I have asked myself for a long time. I think I still want to perceive everything—the beauty, the sorrow, the light, and the dark. So, I want to perceive pain and allow time to heal it…\n\n\nAbout [PTSD]…\nSometime between 2017 and 2019, I had a major accident alone in Sydney. Funny enough, I usually remember the exact date of significant life events, but since I forced myself to try to erase this one from my memory, I eventually managed to forget the date. Ironically, though, while the date is erased, every detail of the event still lingers in my mind.\nI remember blood everywhere. I remember people calling an ambulance—and how it took forever to arrive because they got lost. I remember feeling cold, shivering. I remember the countless morphine injections. I remember the hopelessness of lying on that hospital bed (didn’t even want to know which hospital I am at), waiting for surgery. Doctors and nurses came to me one by one, introducing themselves before disappearing again. I remember them asking, “Do you have anyone to accompany you to surgery?” And I said no. I remember being told, over and over, how lucky I was—how I had nearly lost my leg if I got hit just 1 cm further-Yes, that’s also one of the conversations I desperately want to erase. But I can’t.\nAfter the surgery, everything felt surreal. Every morning when I woke up, I couldn’t believe it wasn’t just a bad dream—that it had really happened. I struggled to do even the simplest things alone. Going to the toilet, doing housework, taking a shower—every task felt like an uphill battle. I had to learn how to walk again. It took more than half a year’s struggle before I could do basic exercises and bend my knee properly. Every time I felt hopeless, my parents would comfort me, reminding me how fortunate I was—that I hadn’t lost my leg or become disabled. They said it so often that I started to feel guilty for still being depressed. So many people have far worse accidents than me—why couldn’t I just be grateful? I lost many friends during that time. Not because I wanted to push them away, but because I didn’t want to sound like a victim. Yet at the same time, I wasn’t strong enough to pretend I was okay.\nEven after six or seven years, now that I am much calmer, I can finally write down this story for the first time—calmly, without crying. But the ever-present pain of the scar still reminds me of what I went through. And every time the physiotherapist massages my knee during a session, I still feel sick to my stomach. I often find myself avoiding anything that carries even the slightest risk—too many forms of exercise, even driving—because I just don’t feel safe. Every new pain, every “failure,” feels like another blow, hitting me harder each time.\nA month ago, I reunited with an old friend of mine. She was my best friend in primary school, but we lost touch after going to different schools. She has always been one of the incredibly smart kids (which was later confirmed when she took an IQ test and scored high). I, on the other hand, could only achieve average grades no matter how hard I tried, while she effortlessly excelled in tests. Later, I heard she got into her dream school—Carnegie Mellon University in the U.S.—to study computer science. But then, she suddenly developed severe eye floaters and lost her central vision in both eyes. She had no choice but to drop out and spend a year in an eye hospital. After countless desperate days and nights, multiple treatments, and surgeries, she finally regained her eyesight. She then decided to move to Adelaide, Australia, seeking a more balanced and less stressful life compared to the U.S. Because of that, we were able to reunite from time to time.\nI can sense that she is a bit different from others in the way she thinks and behaves. Surprisingly, I found that we share some of the same unusual thoughts and behaviors. There are many things I’ve felt ashamed to share with others—some of which I admit are somewhat unhealthy and that I’ve been trying so hard to improve. But the way she speaks about them so naturally gave me a sense of reassurance and strength. She seems completely at ease with everything that comes her way, yet she still fights against this cruel world in her own unique way. On one hand, I’m happy to have found someone who truly understands and shares the same thoughts as me. On the other, I see a different possibility: maybe I don’t always have to overcome everything. If I can’t change certain things, perhaps I can learn to live with them—while still living earnestly and fully.\n\n\nAbout [Carer Transition]…\nAbout three years ago, I finally made the move to transition from a non-quantitative background to a more quantitative career. Thanks to my partner—whom I met in 2019—his encouragement pushed me to step out of my comfort zone and try out new things. At that time, I felt like I had half given up on life, struggling to overcome PTSD while stuck in a job I hated.\nHowever, I never imagined that I would embark on this quantitative journey. With a bachelor’s degree in pharmacy, my options for a master’s degree were quite limited. Initially, I pursued a Master of Public Health, but halfway through, I found myself increasingly drawn to statistics and programming. That was when I came across a new master’s program specifically designed for those with a health or medical background, even without prior experience in quantitative analysis or programming. I decided to take a leap of faith and give it a try.\nI’ve never told my lecturer this, but it was one of his courses—Statistical Modelling—that solidified my determination to continue this path. As someone without any formal quantitative training, who often felt like I was losing the will to live whenever I encountered mathematical equations, learning quantitative concepts through statistical software was very helpful starting point. I never told him directly, but I believe I once sent him an email after the course ended, thanking him for “opening the world of statistics to me”.\nI consider myself very lucky because I believe that 60–70% of my efforts have been rewarded in the end. Many times, hard work doesn’t lead to any recognition or results, so I feel incredibly fortunate and grateful that, so far, every project I’ve embarked on has had tangible outcomes. Even though some (or most) of my past works to date may not have been of good quality, that doesn’t bother me. What matters is that I’ve poured my heart and soul into every project, and I’m grateful for the opportunity to learn and grow—slowly but steadily—over time.\nHowever, I have to say that the biggest challenge for someone without formal quantitative training is the lack of abstract, logical, systematic, and step-by-step thinking. This is the most noticeable difference I’ve observed between non-quantitative and quantitative individuals. It’s not just in research—quantitative thinkers tend to approach even the simplest life questions with a structured, logical, step-by-step mindset.\nI’ve never tried to hide the fact that I’m not a very logical person. As a Perceiving type in the MBTI personality framework, I often do things without a plan and tend to jump from one thing to another. This often makes me wonder whether being an analyst is truly the right path for me. Despite that, I’m deeply grateful for every opportunity that has come my way and for the chance to keep learning. Through all of life’s ups and downs, I have never stopped discovering myself and searching for my true path.\n\n\nAbout [This Blog]…\nThere’s no real meaning in writing this blog. However, I’ve come to realize that this is the first time I’ve ever written down—or even talked about—my PTSD. The fact that I can now put it into words so calmly means that time has already healed much of my pain.\nI wrote this simply because I have a lot of free time to kill during my career break. I have so much free time now that I can waste an entire day writing this seemingly meaningless blog. Still, I believe that the ability—and the willingness—to express yourself, even when there’s no audience, is a kind of happiness. And for that, I am happy with the time I spent writing this down 🙂.\n\n\nAbout [一半人生]…\nThere’s a song by Mayday that I really love, and its lyrics kinds of resonate with how I feel right now…\n[在某個清晨 回望我一生 活得雖認真 卻微小如塵\n想要唱首歌 去唱哭別人 最後卻是我 滿臉淚痕\n早告別青春 活成了別人 經歷的時代 已如此陌生\n年少時的話 又不敢承認 低頭在人海 浮浮沉沉\n我的一半人生 飄蕩就像只風箏 如果命運是風 什麼又是我的繩\n我的一半人生 冷暖就讓我自己過問 有熱愛有恨 有未知的前程\n在某個清晨 回望我一生 活得雖認真 卻微小如塵\n想要唱首歌 去唱哭別人 最後卻是我 滿臉淚痕\n早告別青春 活成了別人 經歷的時代 已如此陌生\n年少時的話 又不敢承認 低頭在人海 浮浮沉沉\n我的一半人生 飄蕩就像只風箏 如果命運是風 什麼又是我的繩\n我的一半人生 冷暖就讓我自己過問 有熱愛有恨 有未知的前程\n我的一半人生 飄蕩就像只風箏 如果命運是風 什麼又是我的繩\n我的一半人生 冷暖就讓我自己過問 有熱愛有恨 有未知的前程\n有熱愛有恨 有未知的前程]\n“My half-life, let me face its warmth and cold on my own. There is passion, there is hate. There is an unknown future.”\nYep, that makes a good ending to this seemingly meaningless blog.\n      Weisi  24 March 2025"

    "section": "",
    "text": "Nanjing, a city that satisfies all my definitions of a “perfect city.” With the lens of the China’s ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: “I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here.”\nSome say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.\nIn my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.\nIf given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).\n\nMoments in Nanjing\n\n1. A flock of doves soaring through the sky at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage 🕊️\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage on 16 Jan 2025.

Wintersweet blossoms smell really nice.\n\n \n\nThe bald cypress trees by Yanque Lake in the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties create a stunning scene during autumn and winter.\n\n \n\nThe stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.\n\n\n3. Climbing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and overlooking Zijin Mountain and Nanjing City\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Treasures in Nanjing Museum - The Enchantment of China’s Ancient Capital of the Six Dynasties\n\n- Jade clothes sewn with golden threat (金缕玉衣) from Western Han (202 BCE-8 CE)\n\n\n\nLike many ancient civilizations, the people of the Han dynasty believed in the immortality of the soul. They thought that if the body was well-preserved, the soul could one day reunite with the body, enabling rebirth. Therefore, they placed great emphasis on preserving the physical form. They believed that jade, as a substance imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, could prevent the body from decaying and symbolize noble status. As a result, nobles spared no expense, dedicating vast resources to crafting jade artifacts in pursuit of immortality. After death, they were dressed in jade burial suits, rested their heads on jade pillows, held jade pigs in their hands, and sealed their orifices with jade plugs. Some even adorned wooden coffins with jade pieces, leading to significant advancements in the use of jade for funerary purposes. \n\n\n- Treasure of the Museum: Golden creature (金兽) from around Qin & Han Dynasty (221 BCE-8 CE)\n\n \n\nWith a gold content of 99% and weighing 9,100 grams, it is the heaviest ancient gold cast artifact unearthed in China to date, and is referred to as the ‘Treasure of Protection’. It has certainly drawn a massive crowd, with people eagerly surrounding it to take pictures! \n\n\n-The prettiest: Rose quartz covered incense burner (芙蓉石蟠螭耳盖炉) from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Golden plate with the design of S-shaped cloud (如意云纹金盘) from Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tri-colored pottery camel (三彩骆驼🐫) from Tang Dynasty (618 to 907)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Some delicate clocks 🕰️ from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Taste in Nanjing 🥟🦆🍲\nNanjing is renowned for its duck cuisine, so much so that there is a famous saying: “No duck can escape Nanjing alive.” From Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup and Nanjing Roasted Duck to Salted Duck, Duck Fat Pastry, and Braised Duck Feet, the city offers an incredible array of mouthwatering duck dishes.\nBeyond its mastery of duck, Nanjing is also famous for its diverse dumpling offerings. Favorites include Roast Duck Dumplings, Crab Roe Soup Dumplings, Mini Wontons, and Pan-Fried Dumplings.\n\n- Nanjing Roasted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Salted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Crab Roe Soup Dumplings"

Inspired by this enchanting sight, I created the figure below in R during the trip (with help from ChatGPT—and a lot of iterations 😁). It definitely helped pass the time while I was waiting (endlessly) at the airport and enduring nearly 10 hours on the plane!!!\nWishing everyone a Happy Chinese New Year of the Snake 🐍 2025!🧨🎇🎉🧧\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSource code for creating the above figure:\n\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tibble)\n\n\nStep 1: Create a red lantern by coding all the components that make up the lantern.\n\nlantern_body &lt;- tibble(\n  x = cos(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)),\n  y = sin(seq(0, 2 * pi, length.out = 100)) * 0.6 # Oval shape\n)\n\n# Decorative gold band at the top and bottom\ngold_band_top &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(-0.8, 0.8, 0.8, -0.8),\n  y = c(0.6, 0.6, 0.5, 0.5)\n)\n\ngold_band_bottom &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(-0.8, 0.8, 0.8, -0.8),\n  y = c(-0.5, -0.5, -0.6, -0.6)\n)\n\n# Tassels at the bottom\ntassels &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(-0.5, -0.3, 0, 0.3, 0.5),\n  xend = c(-0.5, -0.3, 0, 0.3, 0.5),\n  y = rep(-0.6, 5),\n  yend = rep(-1.0, 5)\n)\n\n# Hanging string at the top\nhanging_string &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(0, 0),\n  y = c(0.6, 0.75)  # Longer hanging string for traditional look\n)\n\n# Chinese knot at the top\nchinese_knot &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(0, 0.1, -0.1, 0),\n  y = c(0.75, 0.85, 0.85, 0.75)\n)\n\n# Star-like lights (small golden stars on the lantern)\nstars &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(0.2, -0.5, 0.6, -0.4, 0.3),\n  y = c(0.5, 0.6, -0.4, -0.6, -0.7),\n  size = c(2, 1.5, 1.8, 1, 1.7)\n)\n\n# Additional decorative curved lines on the lantern body\ncurved_lines &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(0, 0.5, 1, 0.5, 0),\n  y = c(0.3, 0.5, 0.3, -0.5, -0.7)\n)\n\n# More golden dots along the body of the lantern\ndots &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(-0.3, 0.4, -0.4, 0.5, 0.2),\n  y = c(0.4, 0.5, -0.4, -0.5, -0.6)\n)\n\n# Adding vertical semi-circle curved lines\nsemi_circles_vertical &lt;- tibble(\n  x = c(-0.6, -0.4, 0, 0.4, 0.7),  # X positions for vertical curves\n  y_start = rep(0.5, 5),  # Start at the top of the lantern\n  y_end = rep(-0.5, 5),  # End at the bottom of the lantern\n  curvature = c(-0.5, 0.5, -0.5, 0.5, -0.5)  # Same curvature for a semi-circle effect\n)\n\n\n\nStep 2: Create a function to arrange the positions (x and y) of multiple lanterns within a single figure.\n\ncreate_lantern_layers &lt;- function(offset_x = 0, offset_y = 0) {\n  list(\n    # Lantern body\n    geom_polygon(\n      data = lantern_body %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y),\n      fill = \"red\", color = \"darkred\", size = 1.5\n    ),\n    # Gold band at the top\n    geom_polygon(\n      data = gold_band_top %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y),\n      fill = \"gold\", color = \"goldenrod\", size = 1.5\n    ),\n    # Gold band at the bottom\n    geom_polygon(\n      data = gold_band_bottom %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y),\n      fill = \"gold\", color = \"goldenrod\", size = 1.5\n    ),\n    # Tassels at the bottom\n    geom_segment(\n      data = tassels %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, xend = xend + offset_x, y = y + offset_y, yend = yend + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y, xend = xend, yend = yend),\n      color = \"goldenrod\", size = 1.5\n    ),\n    # Hanging string\n    geom_segment(\n      data = hanging_string %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y, xend = x, yend = y + 0.2),\n      color = \"gold\", size = 1.2\n    ),\n    # Chinese knot at the top\n    geom_polygon(\n      data = chinese_knot %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y),\n      fill = \"gold\", color = \"goldenrod\", size = 1.5\n    ),\n    # Tiny stars/lights around the lantern\n    geom_point(\n      data = stars %&gt;% mutate(x = x + offset_x, y = y + offset_y),\n      aes(x = x, y = y, size = size),\n      color = \"gold\", alpha = 0.8,\n      show.legend = FALSE\n    ),\n    # Add vertical semi-circle curved lines on the lantern body\n    geom_curve(\n      aes(x = offset_x -

    "section": "",
    "text": "Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, I began to deeply miss everything in Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red maple leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweet blossoms and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.\nDue to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.\nYet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).\nSo here it is—Hangzhou, my hometown and my beloved city.\n\nThings must do in Hangzhou\n\n1. Wait for sunset at the lakeside 🌅.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Yongjinmen on 20 Jan 2025, located on the southern shore of West Lake.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Jixian Pavilion on 23 Jan 2025.\n\n\n2. Visit the so-called ‘most beautiful corner’ of Gushan.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Gushan on 20 Jan 2025, located on the northern shore of West Lake.\n\n\n3. Go to Beishan street and see the red maple leaves 🍁 in autumn.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Beishan street on 7 Jan 2025, located on the northern shore of West Lake.\n\n\n4. Go to Bai Causeway and see the willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind 🍃.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Bai Causeway on 23 Jan 2025, located on the northern shore of West Lake.  Bai Causeway is a picturesque path lined with willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind. This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):\n孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。 几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。 乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。 最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。 (To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion,  The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low. Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud. Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves. I love strolling along the east side of the lake most, Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.) \n\n\n5. Take a boat tour around West Lake 🚤.\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi on a boat around West Lake on 23 Jan 2025, passing Beishan street, Broken Bridge and Bai Causeway.\n\n\n6. Go to Hefang ancient street to witness the bustling prosperity of the marketplace 🍜🍛🍲🥟.\n\n    \n\n\n\n\nPhotos and videos taken by Weisi at Hefang ancient street on 7 Jan 2025."

    "title": "About Nanjing | 金陵印象",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Nanjing, a city that satisfies all my definitions of a “perfect city.” With the lens of the China’s ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: “I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here.”\nSome say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.\nIn my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.\nIf given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues covered by golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage, and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).\n\nMoments in Nanjing\n\n1. A flock of doves soaring through the sky at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage 🕊️\n\n\n\nFilmed by Weisi at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage on 16 Jan 2025. A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing.  Doves are free, and so are we.\n\n\n2. Red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms\n\n  \n\nRed walls paired with wintersweet blossoms in winter. Wintersweet blossoms smell really nice.\n\n \n\nThe bald cypress trees by Yanque Lake in the Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties create a stunning scene during autumn and winter.\n\n\n\nThe stone statue avenue is part of the Sacred Way leading to the tomb, lined with an array of lifelike stone sculptures, including lions, elephants, mythical beasts like qilin, and statues of civil and military officials.\n\n\n3. Climbing Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum and overlooking Zijin Mountain and Nanjing City\n\n\n\n\n\n4. Treasures in Nanjing Museum - The Enchantment of China’s Ancient Capital of the Six Dynasties\n\n- Jade clothes sewn with golden threat (金缕玉衣) from Western Han (202 BCE-8 CE)\n\n\n\nLike many ancient civilizations, the people of the Han dynasty believed in the immortality of the soul. They thought that if the body was well-preserved, the soul could one day reunite with the body, enabling rebirth. Therefore, they placed great emphasis on preserving the physical form. They believed that jade, as a substance imbued with the essence of heaven and earth, could prevent the body from decaying and symbolize noble status. As a result, nobles spared no expense, dedicating vast resources to crafting jade artifacts in pursuit of immortality. After death, they were dressed in jade burial suits, rested their heads on jade pillows, held jade pigs in their hands, and sealed their orifices with jade plugs. Some even adorned wooden coffins with jade pieces, leading to significant advancements in the use of jade for funerary purposes. \n\n\n- Treasure of the Museum: Golden creature (金兽) from around Qin & Han Dynasty (221 BCE-8 CE)\n\n\n\nWith a gold content of 99% and weighing 9,100 grams, it is the heaviest ancient gold cast artifact unearthed in China to date, and is referred to as the ‘Treasure of Protection’. \n\n\n-The prettiest: Rose quartz covered incense burner (芙蓉石蟠螭耳盖炉) from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Golden plate with the design of S-shaped cloud (如意云纹金盘) from Yuan Dynasty (1271 to 1368)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Tri-colored pottery camel (三彩骆驼🐫) from Tang Dynasty (618 to 907)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Some delicate clocks 🕰️ from Qing Qianlong Dynasty (1644–1911/12)\n\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n5. Taste in Nanjing 🥟🦆🍲\nNanjing is renowned for its duck cuisine, so much so that there is a famous saying: “No duck can escape Nanjing alive.” From 鸭血粉丝汤 (Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup) and 南京烤鸭 (Nanjing Roasted Duck) to 盐水鸭 (Salted Duck), 鸭油酥饼 (Duck Fat Pastry), and 卤鸭掌 (Braised Duck Feet), the city offers an incredible array of mouthwatering duck dishes.\nBeyond its mastery of duck, Nanjing is also famous for its diverse dumpling offerings. Favorites include 烤鸭包 (Roast Duck Dumplings), 蟹黄汤包 (Crab Roe Soup Dumplings), 小馄饨 (Mini Wontons), and 煎饺 (Pan-Fried Dumplings), each showcasing the city’s rich culinary traditions.\n\n- Nanjing Roasted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Duck Blood Vermicelli Soup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Salted Duck\n\n\n\n\n\n\n- Crab Roe Soup Dumplings"

    "text": "About Hangzhou\nHangzhou (杭州) is the capital city of the Zhejiang providence. Nestled in the heart of eastern China, Hangzhou is a city where timeless charm meets vibrant modernity. Renowned for its breathtaking West Lake (西湖), a symbol of natural beauty and serenity, Hangzhou has inspired poets and painters for centuries. Beyond its historic allure, the city thrives as a hub of innovation, home to global tech giant Alibaba and a burgeoning digital economy. With its harmonious blend of ancient temples, bustling markets, cutting-edge architecture, and verdant tea plantations, Hangzhou offers a captivating journey through history and progress.\n\n\nHefang Street (河坊街)\nHefang Ancient Street (河坊街) is one of Hangzhou’s oldest and most iconic streets, tracing its origins back to the Southern Song Dynasty and reaching its peak prosperity in the Qing Dynasty. It serves as a vibrant window into the city’s rich cultural heritage, where the echoes of history come alive amidst a bustling modern scene. This historic pedestrian street is adorned with beautifully preserved Qing Dynasty-style architecture and is a treasure trove of traditional crafts, local delicacies, and cultural charm. Among its highlights is Huqingyutang(胡庆余堂), a renowned traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) pharmacy and museum established in 1874. Additionally, artisans craft intricate calligraphy brushes, delicate silk umbrellas, and other traditional goods, while food stalls offer classic Hangzhou treats like beggar’s chicken (叫花鸡) and sweet osmanthus cake (桂花糕). Hefang Ancient Street is a unique journey through time, blending the allure of the past with the vitality of the present.\n\n \n\n\nHefang Street (河坊街): A historic street blending cultural heritage with modern vibrancy.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe outer wall of Huqingyutang (胡庆余堂): A renowned traditional Chinese medicine pharmacy.\n\n\n \n\n\nThe inside of Huqingyutang (胡庆余堂): It offers a diverse range of products including traditional Chinese medicines, health supplements, and herbal teas.\n\n\n\n\n\nHuqingyutang (胡庆余堂) clinics, which specialize in providing traditional Chinese medicine services.\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\nHefang Street (河坊街) offers an incredible variety of food, snacks and drinks.\n\n\n\n\n景阳观 (Jingyangguan): A renowned brand specializing in traditional Chinese pickled vegetables, commonly known as 酱菜.\n\n \n\n\n羊汤饭店 (Yang Tang Fan Dian), established in 1788 during the 53rd year of Emperor Qianlong’s reign, is one of Hangzhou’s oldest and most esteemed culinary establishments. When the Manchus arrived in Hangzhou, they avoided pork and instead opened a lamb-focused restaurant, which became known for its lamb-centric dishes. The restaurant’s signature offerings include 羊肉烧卖 (Lamb Shaomai) and 羊杂汤 (Lamb Offal Soup).\n\n\n\nBeishan St (北山街) | Lingering Snow on Broken Bridge (断桥残雪) &lt;一条北山街，半步民国史&gt;\nBeishan Street (北山街) is a picturesque historic avenue that runs along the northern shore of the iconic West Lake. Known for its blend of natural beauty and cultural heritage, the street is lined with ancient trees, traditional Chinese architecture, and several historical sites, including former residences of notable figures and old temples. The area exudes a tranquil charm, making it a favorite spot for leisurely strolls, photography, and cultural exploration. Visitors often admire its cobblestone paths, scenic lake views, and the way it seamlessly combines modernity with history. Beishan Street is not just a thoroughfare but a journey into Hangzhou’s rich past, offering a serene retreat from the city’s bustling pace.\n\n\n\n北山街 (Beishan St) in the winter.

The 保叔塔 (Boshu Pagoda) is a historic and iconic landmark situated on 宝石山 (Precious Stone Hill) near the northern shores of West Lake. Its origins trace back to 五代十国 (Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms) period, build in 968. Historically, the pagoda served both a religious purpose - as a Buddhist structure, it symbolized blessings and peace.  Over the centuries, the Baoshu Pagoda has undergone multiple reconstructions due to damage from natural wear and conflicts. The most recent restoration was completed in the 20th century, ensuring its preservation for future generations. The pagoda is renowned for its slender and elegant design, standing at 45.3 meters tall. Its architectural style is distinct, with a gracefully tapering structure that appears almost like a delicate needle pointing toward the sky. Hence, there is an old saying: “湖上两浮屠，宝石如美人，雷峰如老衲” (“The two pagodas on the lake, Baoshu like a beautiful woman, Leifeng like an old monk”). Today, the Baoshu Pagoda remains a beloved feature of Hangzhou’s landscape, admired for its historical importance and the breathtaking views it offers of West Lake and the surrounding area. Its presence is a testament to the city’s long-standing cultural and architectural achievements. \n\n\nBai Causeway (白堤)  &lt;最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤&gt;\n\n\n\n Photo captured by Weisi on January 7, 2025. Bai Causeway (白堤) in winter—a picturesque path lined with willow trees swaying gracefully in the wind. This serene scene evokes the timeless beauty of spring, when the causeway comes alive with vibrant willow trees, blooming flowers, and elegant bridges. Inspired by such scenery, the renowned Tang Dynasty poet Bai Juyi (白居易) penned the famous poem 《钱塘湖春行》 (Spring Walk by Qiantang Lake):\n孤山寺北贾亭西，水面初平云脚低。 几处早莺争暖树，谁家新燕啄春泥。 乱花渐欲迷人眼，浅草才能没马蹄。 最爱湖东行不足，绿杨阴里白沙堤。\n(To the north of Gushan Temple and west of Jia Pavilion,  The water surface just leveled, with clouds hanging low. Early orioles vie for warm trees, while new swallows peck at spring mud. Wildflowers almost dazzle the eyes, and tender grass barely covers horse hooves. I love strolling along the east side of the lake most, Where green willows cast their shade over the white sandy causeway.)"

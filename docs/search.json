    "text": "Born and raised in Hangzhou, I spent eighteen years there before moving to Sydney, Australia. During my years in Hangzhou, I didn’t fully appreciate its beauty, often feeling more drawn to larger cities like Shanghai and Beijing. However, after relocating to Sydney, I began to deeply miss everything in Hangzhou—the weeping willows by the lake in spring, the blooming lotus flowers in summer, the vibrant red maple leaves on Beishan Street in autumn and the pervasive scent of osmanthus in the air, the wintersweets and the misty mornings of drizzly winter days. Even my mom’s homemade Hangzhou cuisine, though not entirely authentic, became a cherished memory.\nDue to COVID restrictions and work and study commitments, I hadn’t been home in six years. When I finally returned, I was struck by a profound sense of alienation. Familiar restaurants and shops near my home had disappeared. The large square where people once gathered to dance, socialize, and sing had been replaced by two sprawling shopping malls. The city itself had transformed—its subway system had expanded from just two lines six years ago to eight lines, now covering almost every corner. Towering high-rises filled the cityscape, one after another, creating a stark contrast to the Hangzhou I once knew.\nYet, amidst all these changes, West Lake remained the same. Walking along its shores, I was once again captivated by its timeless beauty and serenity. Some say Hangzhou is defined by just one lake, but to me, its charm lies in so much more—the natural landscapes, cultural and historical heritage, poetry, and art. It’s no wonder Bai Juyi, the renowned Tang dynasty poet, once wrote: “When I recall the south of the Yangtze River, Hangzhou comes foremost to my mind” (忆江南，最忆是杭州).\nSo here it is—Hangzhou, my hometown and my beloved city.\n\nThings must do in Hangzhou\n\n1.

Go to the Beishan street and see the red maple leaves 🍁 in autumn.\n\n\n\nA video captured by Weisi at Beishan street on 7 Jan 2025, located on the northern shore of West Lake."

    "title": "About Nanjing | 金陵印象",
    "section": "",
    "text": "Nanjing, a city that fulfill all my definitions of a “perfect city.” With the lens of the China’s ancient capital of Six Dynasties, a collision of feudalism and democracy. It was also the first city I traveled to alone as an adult on an impromptu trip. Revisiting Nanjing twelve years later, I resonate even more deeply with what an old friend told me back then: “I really like Nanjing, and I hope to stay here.”\nSome say Nanjing is a melancholic city, bearing the scars of the eras that have shaped it. It has witnessed the rise and fall of dynasties, cycling through prosperity and devastation. From the grinding edge of hardship, it has emerged resilient, transformed through the trials of war, and settled into a state of gentle warmth and depth.\nIn my eyes, Nanjing is a tender city, like a woman who has weathered the storms of life—mature, emotional, yet retaining a childlike innocence. In her timeworn features, I see eyes like warm jade, framed by hills as her skirt, rivers as her flowing hair, and the mighty Yangtze River encircling her like a belt.\nIf given the chance, I would love to return to Nanjing again: to see the red walls of Imperial Tombs of the Ming and Qing Dynasties paired with wintersweet blossoms, to stroll down the Wutong avenues blanketed with golden trees, to watch flocks of pigeons at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage，and to take a night boat along the Qinhuai River. I truly love Nanjing; its beauty is as timeless as its ancient name: Jinling (金陵).\n\nMoments in Nanjing\n\n1. A flock of doves soaring through the sky at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage\n\n\n\nA video captured by Weisi at Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum Music Stage on 16 Jan 2025. A flock of doves soaring through the sky is a romance unique to Nanjing. Doves are free, and so are we."
